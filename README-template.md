## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- JSON
- Desktop-first workflow to mobile
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned at the end when debugging my code, a great way to debug and remove the horizontal scroll on mobile is using the outline inside the universal selector bracket inside your css, and putting a border at 1px solid [color] to find which area is overlapping.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
* {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This resource helped me get a refresher on the basics of using css styles regarding to applying the styles to my container and main tags. This resource also helped when needing to refresh myself on using linear-gradient colors for the details on the left side of the card.
- [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey) - Github docs helped me understand and learn to fix SSH permissions denied when pushing my first commit to my new intialized repo for the challenge.
